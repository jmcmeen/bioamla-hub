# BioAMLA - BioAcoustics for Machine Learning Applications

The BIOAMLA project is a collection of resources for introductory topics in bioacoustics, sound processing, and machine learning. 

## Datasets
- [Steele Creek Park Wetlands, Bristol, TN 2023](datasets/scp_2023/README.md) : 
This audio dataset contains 2822 wav/mp3 files collected from five locations in Steele Creek Park from Feb. through Sept. 2023. 
- [Braulio Carillo National Park/ La Selva Research Station, Costa Rica 2024](datasets/costa_rica_2024/README.md) :
This audio dataset contains 601 wav/mp3 files (600 hours) collected from five locations at Braulio Carillo National Park, Costa Rica from July 9th - 24th, 2024.

## Notebooks
- [Using PyINaturlist To Retrieve Data Collected at La Selva](notebooks/inaturalist_la_selva.ipynb)
- [Wave File Dissection (Basics)](notebooks/dissecting_wav_files.ipynb)
- [Testing GPU Capabilities for PyTorch](notebooks/torch_gpu_test.ipynb)

## Apps
- [Streamlit App for Audio Classification Using AST](/apps/ast_audio_classifier/README.md)

## Notes
Supplementary code examples are being developed to demonstrate bioacoustics and machine learning techniques using Python / Jupyter notebooks. These xamples will run best on a GPU equipped device. Code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS and Python 3.11.9 using both Nvidia GTX 1660Ti 6GB and RTX 4060 Ti 8GB GPUs.

This repository is currently a work in progress with mutiple updates through Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. Check back for updates.
