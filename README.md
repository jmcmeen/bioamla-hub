# BioAMLA - BioAcoustics & Machine Learning Applications

The BIOAMLA project is a collection of resources for introductory topics in bioacoustics, sound processing, and machine learning. 

## BioAMLA DataSets
Datasets are located at [jmcmeen/bioamla-datasets](https://github.com/jmcmeen/bioamla-datasets). 

## Notebooks
- [Using PyINaturlist To Retrieve Data Collected at La Selva](notebooks/inaturalist_la_selva.ipynb)
- [Wave File Dissection (Basics)](notebooks/dissecting_wav_files.ipynb)
- [Testing GPU Capabilities for PyTorch](notebooks/torch_gpu_test.ipynb)

## Apps
- [Streamlit App for Audio Classification Using AST](/apps/ast_audio_classifier/)

## Notes
Supplementary code examples are being developed to demonstrate bioacoustics and machine learning techniques using Python / Jupyter notebooks. These samples will run best on a GPU equipped device. Code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS and Python 3.11.9 using both Nvidia GTX 1660Ti 6GB and RTX 4060 Ti 8GB GPUs.

This repository is currently a work in progress with mutiple updates anticipated through in Summer 2025. Check back for updates.
